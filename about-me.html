      In which I describe major research projects and their impact.
    </p>
    <h3>Enhancing Ergonomics in Cat-Human Spaces</h3>
	<p>Funding source: National Institute of Feline Health and Wellness (NIFHW)</p>
	<p>In this groundbreaking research project, Kat Cattery focused on investigating ways to improve the ergonomic design of shared living and working spaces for cats and humans. The study aimed to enhance the physical and psychological well-being of both species by creating comfortable and functional environments. The project received generous funding from the NIFHW, an organization dedicated to advancing feline health and promoting harmonious cat-human interactions. The funding allowed for extensive data collection, innovative design experiments, and the development of ergonomic guidelines that benefited both cats and humans in cohabitation settings.</p>
    <h3>Exploring User Experience in Cat-Friendly Office Environments</h3>
	<p>Funding Source: Corporate Grant from MeowTech Corporation</p>
	<p>Kat Cattery collaborated with MeowTech Corporation, a leading provider of cat-friendly office solutions, to investigate the user experience of employees working in cat-friendly office environments. The project aimed to understand how the presence of cats in the workplace impacted employee well-being, productivity, and job satisfaction. With the generous support of a corporate grant from MeowTech Corporation, Kat Cattery conducted surveys, interviews, and on-site observations in various office settings. The findings not only shed light on the benefits and challenges of cat-friendly workplaces but also influenced the design of future office spaces that seamlessly integrate cats into the work environment.</p>
	<h3>Designing Ergonomic Cat Furniture for Optimal Comfort</h3>
	<p>Funding Source: Kitty Comfort Foundation</p>
	<p>The Kitty Comfort Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the well-being of cats, provided funding for Kat Cattery's research project on designing ergonomic cat furniture. The study aimed to develop innovative furniture designs that prioritize feline comfort and promote healthy behaviors such as scratching, stretching, and resting. Through a combination of scientific research, user feedback, and iterative prototyping, Kat Cattery explored materials, shapes, and features that would enhance the overall well-being of cats. The support from the Kitty Comfort Foundation enabled extensive testing and the creation of practical and aesthetically pleasing cat furniture designs that have the potential to positively impact the lives of countless feline companions.</p>
